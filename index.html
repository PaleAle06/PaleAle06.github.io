        <p>"Did you ever hear the tragedy of <strong>Darth Plagueis The Wise</strong>?<br> I thought not.
            It is not a story the Jedi would tell you.</p>
        <p>It is a Sith legend. <strong>Darth Plagueis</strong> was a <strong>Dark Lord of the Sith</strong>,<br>
            so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life.<br>
            He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br>
            The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.<br>
            He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,<br>
            which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,<br>
            then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. <em>Ironic</em>. He could save others from death,<br>
            but not himself." - <strong>Sheev Palpatine</strong> or <strong>Darth Sidious</strong></p>
