        <h1>The Elephant</h1>
        <p style="word-spacing: 1em;">
            An elephant slept in his bunk,<br>
            And in slumber his chest rose and sunk.<br>
            But he snored-how he snored!<br>
            All the other beasts roared,<br>
            So his wife tied a knot with his trunk.

        <h1>Fully Little Fellow</h1>
        <p style="letter-spacing: 10px;">
            A funny young fellow named Perkins<br>
            Was terribly fond of small gherkins.<br>
            One day after tea<br>
            He ate ninety three<br>
            And pickled his internal workings.

        <h1>Purple Cow</h1>
        <p style="text-decoration: wavy;">
            I never saw a Purple Cow,<br>
            I never hope to see one;<br>
            But I can tell you, anyhow,<br>
            I would rather see than be one.
