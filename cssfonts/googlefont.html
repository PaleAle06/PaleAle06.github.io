            Black Ops One - James Grieshaber, Eben Sorkin<br>
            Black Ops One is a low contrast, semi<br>
            geometric typeface inspired by military<br>
            stencil lettering. It is heavy, sturdy,<br>
            punchy, and looks best when used at medium<br>
            to large sizes because of the small cuts<br>
            found in stencils.

            Pixelify Sans - Stefie Justprince<br>
            Pixelify Sans fonts are a unique style<br>
            of typography that originated in the 1980s<br>
            with the rise of computer graphics and video<br>
            games. Pixel fonts are characterized by<br>
            their blocky, pixelated appearance, which<br>
            is achieved by using a grid of small, square<br>
            pixels to create each letterform.
