        There's much written on www about history of the<br>
        Internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet<br>
        browser on the web - Mosaic.
        </p>
            <p><blockquote>
            Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical<br>
            World Wide Web browser, released on April 22,<br>
            1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.<br>
            A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later.

        Today's Internet browsers we use today<br>
        (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.),<br>
        got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.<br>
        This and much more can be found at</q>
