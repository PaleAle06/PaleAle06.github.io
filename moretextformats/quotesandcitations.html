        There's much written on www about history of the
        Internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet
        browser on the web - Mosaic.
        </p>
            <p><blockquote>
            Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical
            World Wide Web browser, released on April 22,
            1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.
            A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later.

        Today's Internet browsers we use today
        (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.),
        got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.
